# zoocasa_real_estate_web_scraper
I am working on this web scraper for zoocasa and needed some help in getting it to run on multiple pages. Currently I am generating and rotating random proxies as well as changing user agents on each page however I am only able to get the first page of data returned. Any suggestions here are highly welcomed!
